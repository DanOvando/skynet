This project seeks to generate estimates of fish abundance across space and time using data on fishing behavior derived from Global Fishing Watch. 

This document provides a "proof of concept", evaluating performance metrics across alternative models for the "SpaceFish" assessment method. Performance here will be primarily measured by out-of-sample predictive power at a variety of scales, as this is the primary goal of this method (to be able to predict spatio-temporal trends in abundance in locations covered by GFW but lacking scientific surveys of abundance).
